fix(admin): resolve circular dependency in subscription services

Fixed an error occurring when clicking on the "Customer Overview" link in the subscriptions admin page:

- Fixed circular dependency between SubscriptionService and PayPalSubscriptionService
- Modified SubscriptionServiceProvider to properly register PayPalTokenService and PayPalAPIService
- Updated SubscriptionService to accept nullable PayPalSubscriptionService and added setter method
- Added error handling to Customer Subscription Overview component methods
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with version 1.2.11

The error "trim(): Argument #1 ($string) must be of type string, array given" was caused by a circular 
dependency that prevented services from being properly initialized.

- Enhanced error descriptions to provide clearer guidance to users
- Ensured consistent design language with the dashboard theme
- Implemented responsive design for all screen sizes
- Added subtle micro-interactions for improved user experience

These changes provide a more engaging, informative, and visually appealing
experience when users encounter error pages, maintaining brand consistency
and improving the overall user journey even during error states.
