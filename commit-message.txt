fix: Admin customer and subscription issues

This commit addresses multiple issues related to the admin dashboard's customer and subscription functionality:

1. Customer Overview:
   - Added missing customer detail view (admin.customers.show)
   - Created new route in web.php for viewing detailed customer information
   - Fixed "Route [admin.customers.show] not defined" error when clicking "View Customer"
   - Added comprehensive UI showing customer details, subscription data, and usage metrics
   - Added error handling for usage stats and feature limits

2. Subscription Metrics:
   - Fixed SQL errors in the metrics dashboard due to ambiguous column references
   - Qualified all table column references in join queries
   - Fixed SQLite compatibility issues with string literal quoting
   - Improved query structure for calculating MRR/ARR with proper conditions
   - Enhanced error handling for database queries

3. Documentation:
   - Updated CHANGELOG.md with versions 1.2.11 and 1.2.12
