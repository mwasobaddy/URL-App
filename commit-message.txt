feat(ui): redesign error pages with modern UI/UX

Redesigned all error pages with modern, responsive UI and interactive SVG illustrations:

- Completely revamped the error pages base layout (minimal.blade.php) with:
  - Modern blue gradient background
  - Split-screen layout (content + illustration)
  - Enhanced typography using Poppins font
  - Advanced animation effects (float, pulse, shimmer)
  - Improved button design with hover effects

- Added custom SVG illustrations specific to each error type:
  - 404 (Not Found): Person on scooter looking for connection
  - 403 (Forbidden): Shield and lock security visualization
  - 500 (Server Error): Server rack with error indicators
  - 503 (Service Unavailable): Maintenance worker with tools
  - 419 (Page Expired): Key/token visualization with timeout indicators
  - 429 (Too Many Requests): Traffic light with queue visualization
  - 401 (Unauthorized): Padlock with login form visualization
  - 402 (Payment Required): Credit card and payment terminal

- Enhanced error descriptions to provide clearer guidance to users
- Ensured consistent design language with the dashboard theme
- Implemented responsive design for all screen sizes
- Added subtle micro-interactions for improved user experience

These changes provide a more engaging, informative, and visually appealing
experience when users encounter error pages, maintaining brand consistency
and improving the overall user journey even during error states.
